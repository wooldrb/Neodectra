/* README for Neodectra */
Neodectra is a custom firmware for the Arduino intended for use with the
Audectra client for Windows and AdaFruit NeoPixel strips. This firmware was
heavily based off of example code provided by both Audectra itself and the
NeoPixel tutorials. However, it has evolved to where I consider Neodectra
completely independent of either of those projects.

It includes some custom routines for displaying the data provided by Audectra
in a few unique ways not implemented by the standard Audectra firmware.


==/* INSTALL */==
Neodectra:
Download and install the FastSPI libraries into your Arduino IDE. This branch
was coded with FastSPI_LED2 RC5. https://code.google.com/p/fastspi/

Open the INO file in the Arduino IDE.

There are a few things to change in config.h:
	+ DATAPIN, change this to the PIN your NeoPixel strip is wired to on the Arduino
	+ STRIPLEN, change this to the number of LEDs your NeoPixel strip has

Upload to the Arduino.

==/* USING */==
Download and install the Audectra client:
http://www.audectra.com/downloads/ [ONLY v1.0.0 HAS BEEN TESTED!]

Start the client and select the COM port your Arduino is connected to.

Play ALL the music!
